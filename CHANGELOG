acq4-0.9.2 2014-01-10

    API / behavior changes:
        Performance improvements for Camera module, MP285
        generator pulse train parameter "interpulse_length" renamed to "period"
        Renamed "task" -> "taskRunner" for clarity in all TaskGui classes
        Simplified device config format by removing extra config: key from each device 
            (old format is still accepted)
        MultiClamp, Camera configs use 'defaults' instead of 'settings' 
        Slowed down Camera acquisition loop; it was eating too much CPU
    New Features:
        rudimentary "runner" bin/acq4, acq4.bat to start acq4
        Added --profile flag
        function generator now supports execution of multiple python statements rather than just eval()
        TaskRunner interface plots use downsampling and clip-to-view by default.
        Add ability to specify QCam device by unique ID
    Bugfixes:
        Fixed Camera module re-center on camera sensor area after objective switch
        fixed setup.py detection of git status
        Fixed inconsistencies in Laser.oputputPower()
            now returns _only_ the power value
        Fixed improper reload prefix
        Fixed bug when adding task runner analysis modules
        TaskRunner and Manager now stack new docks in tabs to avoid generating excessively large windows
        pg.MultiPlotItem imports correct metaarray module
        Removed calls to non-existent DAQ methods in mock DAQ
        Fix divide by zero in ViewBox
        InfiniteLine cache bounding rect for speedup
    Maintenance:
        Added .mailmap to correct the last 7 years of negligence.
        Removed duplicate entries from util.debug that also exist in pg.debug
        corrected column stretch in taskrunner sequence dock template, axopatch
        
        
acq4-0.9.1 2014-01-03

    API / behavior changes:
        Patch module defaults to -65 mV holding.
        Imager now uses config parameters to determine names of devices to use.
        Moved acq4.py script to acq4/__main__.py; now we start with python -m acq4
        Updated config search path
        setup.py install now copies config inside package install location
        Invert mock camera in example config--this makes stored images appear in
            the same orientation as they were recorded 
            (just to avoid unnecessary confusion)
        Slow down camera module until interactivity bug is handled
        CParser now requires explicit instruction to trigger a header re-parese.
        
    New Features:
        Added innosetup script for building Windows setup.exe

        Removed extra Log button from Manager gui
        Avoid unnecessary rebuild of Ni header cache
        Fixed behavior when no base dir is set
        Imager requests camera module load if it does not exist yet
        Add header cache files, .dll files to dist
        Fixed logging bugs:
            - documentation links work
            - fixed import error in util.debug that prevented errors being logged
            - log window no longer tries to follow its own links (these
              are handled externally)
        Doc link for no-storage-dir error
        Manager no longer creates index in baseDir; this is deferred until a file is added.
        Fixed setup.py config install path on linux
    Maintenance:
        Split documentation into its own repository.
        Many cleanups and additions to example config.
        Reorganized:
            - __init__ now handles most of what was previously in __main__
            - Manager now handles searching for config files
            - added CONFIGPATH global variable listing candidate search paths
        rebuildUi script now accepts path arguments
        cleaned up Manifest.in
        removed the 'storeSVG' and 'storePNG' buttons from the Canvas gui since 
          they were both broken and redundant with ViewBox's export system
        disabled ImageCorrection buttons in MosaicEditor
        fixes/cleanup of mosaic editor and cortexROI code, mosaic editor documentation
